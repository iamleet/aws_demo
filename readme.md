## Notes on AWS ECS
Creating notes per task *CO-2478* Familiarize with the AWS Container Infrastructure. Using the instructions provided by Amazon to spin up docker containers on their ECS service.

#### Vocabulary Concepts
Overview
![Overview](assets/overview.png)

The major components in Amazon ECS are:

* Task Definition: The task definition is a text file, in JSON format, describing the containers that together form an application. Task definitions specify various parameters for the application e.g. container image repositories, ports, storage etc.
* Tasks and Scheduler: A task is an instance of a task definition, created at runtime on a container instance within the cluster. The task scheduler is responsible for placing tasks on container instances.

* Service: A service is a group of tasks that are created and maintained as instances of a task definition. The scheduler maintains the desired count of tasks in the service. A service can optionally run behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service.
* Cluster: A cluster is a logical grouping of EC2 instances on which ECS tasks are run.
* Container Agent: The container agent runs on each EC2 instance within an ECS cluster. The agent sends telemetry data about the instanceâ€™s tasks and resource utilization to Amazon ECS. It will also start and stop tasks based on requests from ECS.
* Image Repository: Amazon ECS downloads container images from container registries, which may exist within or outside of AWS, such as a accessible private Docker registry or Docker Hub.



Example of a JSON *task definition*. The following is an example of a simple task definition containing a single container that runs an Nginx web server.
```json
{
      "family": "webserver",
      "containerDefinitions": [
      {
              "name": "web",
              "image": "nginx",
              "cpu": 99,
              "memory": 100,
              "portMappings": [{
                      "containerPort": 80,
                      "hostPort": 80
              }]
      }]
}
```

### AWS ECS CLI
Amazon provides a high-level commands for ECS using this command line tool to simplify creating, updating, and monitoring clusters and tasks from a local dev environment.

##### Install ECS CLI

For Mac OSX:
```shell
$ sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-ecs-cli/ecs-cli-darwin-amd64-latest
```
For Linux systems:
```shell
$ sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-ecs-cli/ecs-cli-linux-amd64-latest

```
Fix the permission on the executable:
```shell
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli
```

Replace they keys with your own:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ReplaceWithKey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ReplaceWithKey
```

Configure the tool and set the default location(*For this instance I used us-east-2 so I can run tests away from the production environment*):
```shell
ecs-cli configure --region us-east-2 --access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret-key $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --cluster ecs-cli-demo
```


##### Commands
Commands related to ECS deployment process

Check the installed version of ECS cli tool:
```shell
$ ecs-cli --version
ecs-cli version 0.5.0 (1aa8028)
```

### Demo

Steps:
* Create the Cluster where the app will live
* Download the repo or create the yml file
* Bring up the containers based off of the yml

##### Create the Cluster

ECS requires a cluster which will house the environment.
```shell
ecs-cli up --keypair id_rsa --capability-iam --size 2 --instance-type t1.small
```


##### Create the yml

This yml will spin up a hello-world wordpress site (ew) which will later be replaced with the Ruby stack.
```yml
version: '2'
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress
    cpu_shares: 100
    mem_limit: 524288000
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    links:
      - mysql
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    cpu_shares: 100
    mem_limit: 524288000
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: potato.pass
```

OR skip this step if you are working off of the repo.
